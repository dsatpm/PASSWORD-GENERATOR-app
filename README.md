# Password Generator

A program created with JavaScript that creates a random password given a user's preference of type of characters to include.
For source code, visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/dsatpm/password-generator)


## Requirements

This program doesn't require any particular downloads to run. It operates in the browser window. The only requirement necessary is to enter valid parameters to generate the password. If no parameter is selected, no password will be generated.


## Usage

The purpose of this program is to create a unique and random password of a given length chosen by the user that would be difficult to replicate or crack. The password must be at least 8 characters, cannot exceed 128 characters long, and can include certain special characters (!, #, %, etc). The program will not run automatically, and requires the user to click on the 'Generate Password' button colored in red on the page, then follow the prompts (OK = yes, Cancel = no).


## Visuals

Here is a screenshot of my password generator:

I also took creative liberty by using some CSS to alter the way the page looked to better suit my personal style (dark themes, light text)

The app HTML, CSS, and JavaScript template and outline was provided by University of Oregon bootcamp. The program itself was created by Jeremiah Haynes using CSS and JavaScript.
The site was deployed on August 9, 2023.


## Project Stats

When beginning this project, I began programming an app that would create a random password of 12 random characters without any input from the user. I had the generated password displayed on the screen, providing a different password each time the 'Generate Password' button was pressed. After reading through the project README.md, I realized that the acceptance criteria was asking for confirmations and prompts that so the user could control what their password's characters consisted of, the length of the password, and for the password to be displayed in a prompt (this portion was optional). In the JavaScript file, you can see the first program I created is still included; it is just commented out. I chose to leave it in to demonstrate that there are many ways to acheive similar outcomes when writing code. Lastly, I also took some creative liberty and styled the page with some basic CSS properties to give it a style that better suited my own personal tastes (dark themes, light text).
